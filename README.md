## When a rollup, drilldown, slice or dice button is clicked:
#####	1. A method fromt he QueryEngine object is called, this method must return a formatted string that will be displayed in the 'display' component.
##### 2. Change the state calling a method from a StateController object.
##### 3. Notify all the views that there has been a change in the state controller so that they can be updated (This include: CURRENT STATE, COMBO BOXES, I think thats it... but check)
